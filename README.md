As we can observe, there are 2 major components for smart traffic light system, and it requires 2 arduino models
1. Arduino Mega: Responsible for traffic light system and receiving radio signals => [Script](Main/Main.ino)
2. Arduino Pro Micro: Responsible for sending radio signals => [Script](Main/Transmitter.ino)
